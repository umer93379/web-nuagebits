      To get started with Edge Base, please follow the steps outlined below:


      1. **Create a Repository:** Go to the Edge Base repository page on GitHub by visiting the following URL: <https://github.com/processton-io/edge-base>. Once there, click on the "Use this template" button to create a new repository based on Edge Base. This will allow you to have your own copy of the template to work with.

      2. **Sign Up for Netlify CMS:** If you don't have a Netlify CMS account, you will need to sign up for one. Visit <https://app.netlify.com/signup> and create a new account. Netlify CMS provides a user-friendly interface for managing your website's content.

      3. **Deploy Your Repository:** Once you have your repository created and your Netlify CMS account set up, it's time to deploy your Edge Base website. Follow these steps:

         a. Go to <https://app.netlify.com/> and log in to your Netlify CMS account.

         b. Click on the "New site from Git" button to create a new site.

         c. Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and select the repository you created in step 1.

         d. Configure your build settings as needed (e.g., branch to deploy, build command, etc.).

         e. Click on the "Deploy site" button to start the deployment process.

         f. Netlify will build and deploy your website automatically. Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a unique URL for your live website. Apologies for the oversight. Here are the additional steps to enable Netlify Identity and Git Gateway for your Edge Base website deployment:
      4. **Enable Netlify Identity:** Netlify Identity allows you to handle user authentication and manage user accounts for your website. Follow these steps to enable Netlify Identity:

         a. In the Netlify CMS admin interface, click on "Identity" in the left sidebar.

         b. Click on the "Enable Identity" button and follow the prompts to set up Identity for your site.

         c. Customize the registration settings, such as enabling email confirmation or invitation-only sign-up, as per your requirements.

         d. Once Identity is enabled, you can manage user roles and permissions, authentication providers, and other settings from the "Identity" section.
      5. **Enable Git Gateway:** Git Gateway allows Netlify CMS to authenticate and interact with your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to manage your website's content. Follow these steps to enable Git Gateway:

         a. In the Netlify CMS admin interface, click on "Settings" in the left sidebar.

         b. Scroll down to the "Git Gateway" section and click on the "Enable Git Gateway" button.

         c. Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate Netlify CMS with your Git provider and grant the necessary permissions.

         d. Once Git Gateway is enabled, you can use Netlify CMS to create, edit, and publish content directly to your Git repository.
      6. Accessing Netlify CMS: To access the Netlify CMS admin interface and start managing your content, append "/admin" to your website's URL (e.g., `https://your-website-url.com/admin`). Log in with your Netlify CMS credentials, and you will be able to create and edit content using the intuitive CMS interface.


      **\*Note**: Netlify Identity allows you to manage user authentication, while Git Gateway enables seamless content management through Netlify CMS. If you have any further questions or encounter any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to the Netlify CMS support team for assistance.*


      By following these steps, you will have your own instance of Edge Base deployed and ready to use. You can now begin customizing and adding content to your website using the powerful features provided by Netlify CMS.
